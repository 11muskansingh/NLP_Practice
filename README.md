# 🧠 NLP Essentials

Welcome to **NLP Essentials** – a step-by-step, practical repository to learn, implement, and master Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python. This project is ideal for students, data science enthusiasts, and anyone starting their journey into NLP.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide an incremental and hands-on learning experience in NLP.
- Implement core NLP techniques from scratch and using libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn.
- Understand how text data is processed and transformed into numerical features.
- Serve as a personal learning tracker and a useful open-source guide for others.

## 🧩 Key Concepts Covered

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🔹 Text Preprocessing | Clean, normalize and prepare text using tokenization, stopword removal, stemming & lemmatization |
| 🔹 Bag of Words (BoW) | Create a numerical representation of text based on word frequency |
| 🔹 TF-IDF (Coming) | Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency model to weigh terms |
| 🔹 Word Embeddings | Represent words using Word2Vec (upcoming) |
| 🔹 N-Grams | Extract bi-grams, tri-grams for contextual representation |
| 🔹 Cosine Similarity | Measure text similarity using vector space |
|  and much more...

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-essentials.git
cd nlp-essentials
```

### Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

Then download essential NLTK datasets:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```
